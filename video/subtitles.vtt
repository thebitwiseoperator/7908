00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.980
Hello again! We hope you enjoyed the <br /> introduction to Super UHD. 

2
00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:18.500
In the next few modules, you will get an in-depth look at the features that really make Super UHD shine: IPS 4K Quantum Display, Super HDR, and webOS 3.0.

3
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.725
We like to call them The Super Three.

4
00:00:23.925 --> 00:00:27.800
In this training, we’ll be going over the IPS 4K Quantum Display. 

5
00:00:28.125 --> 00:00:33.500
Let’s take a closer look at the panel that displays all of the great content your customer will be watching. 

6
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:42.420
This panel packs a lot of punch—better viewing angles, higher peak brightness, improved black levels, and technologies that produce over one Billion Rich Colors!

7
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000
What’s IPS, exactly? IPS stands for In-Plane Switching, which refers to the alignment of the liquid crystals within the display. 

8
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.120
Compared to a conventional panel, IPS is able to deliver a wider viewing angle for your customers. 

9
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.920
Color and contrast stay more consistent with less color wash even when viewed from extreme angles! 

10
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.000
The colors on conventional panels distort even when sitting slightly off-center. 

11
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:25.500
To show your customers just how great viewing angles are with IPS, just walk them to the extreme left or right of a Super UHD TV and point out how contrast and color stays consistent. 

12
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.725
Now, do the same on a competitor TV, one with a VA panel. The difference is immediately obvious. 

13
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.100
With LG 4K IPS, friends and family can all enjoy content at the same quality from anywhere in the room.

14
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.230
Next, let’s explore the panel’s higher peak brightness. One of the many display technologies LG introduced in 2016 is Ultra Luminance,

15
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.900
a feature that allows the viewer to enjoy more vivid images by improving the peak brightness by up to 30%. 

16
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:06.000
The TV will automatically deliver unused electric current from darker areas of the image where light isn’t needed to the lighter parts that need it.

17
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:14.800
By using LG’s Local Dimming technology, the TV boosts the brightness where it is needed the most. Better contrast means better picture. 

18
00:02:20.125 --> 00:02:25.180
Ultra Luminance gives us the brightness aspect to better contrast. But what about the darkness aspect? 

19
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:35.100
The issue of LCD TVs not being dark enough to show a full range of contrast is solved thanks to LG’s Local Dimming and True Black Panel technologies. 

20
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.125
Super UHD Local Dimming technology enhances contrast and picture detail with a two-step process. 

21
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:51.800
Step 1 involves selectively controlling the strength of the backlight, or LEDs, to ensure shadow detail and picture quality remains consistent.

22
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.800
Step 2 uses this same method to enhance the sharpness.

23
00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.800
The Local Dimming process is automatically done when the TV receives signal that there is a dark part present in a scene.

24
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.100
Customers don’t have to turn on anything to make this magic happen.

25
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:14.800
The second technology LG&#8217;s Super UHD TVs use to improve black levels is what’s called a True Black Panel. 

26
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.800
This is a film applied to the panel of the TV that reduces reflection by scattering ambient light that hits the screen. 

27
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:29.900
With this antiglare reflection film, LG was able to realize a 20% improvement in reflection and glare over previous models. 

28
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:40.600
In short, Local Dimming and True Black give customers a better contrast ratio, deeper black levels, and sharper images, so viewers can see the full beauty of dark scenes.

29
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:50.500
Ok, so we are off to a good start! Better panels with wider viewing angles? Check. Better contrast? Check. How about more colors? 

30
00:03:51.100 --> 00:04:00.000
To enhance color reproduction, LG’s Super UHD TVs have technologies built in that can reproduce
a broader color spectrum and render a wider range of hues,

31
00:04:00.125 --> 00:04:10.400
enabling LG Super UHD TVs to display over one Billion Rich Colors!
This will allow your customers to view pictures with greater depth and realism.

32
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:19.500
The first of these technologies is Color Prime. With Color Prime, 
thicker color filters are used to reproduce more colors in the spectrum. 

33
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:28.900
Conventional LED TVs use a basic color filter that typically reproduces about 97%
of the colors in the HDTV color space. 

34
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:38.550
However, with Color Prime technology, LG Super UHD TVs can expand that color by up to 125% of HDTV color space. 

35
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:48.900
That’s 28% percent more color available that can be viewed on Super UHD TVs! 
More colors mean more “true-to-life” images viewed on Super UHD TVs.

36
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:57.950
The second of the broad color technologies that build even further upon 
Color Prime is Billion Rich Color technology. 

37
00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:12.000
Conventional LED TVs can only display combinations of 256 shades each of red, green, and blue, 
which can create about 16.8 million colors. Sound like a lot? Maybe, but it actually isn’t. 

38
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:19.450
The human eye can see much more. As a result, picture irregularities such as 
contrast bandwidth and color banding can result.

39
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:33.120
With LG Super UHD TVs, each red, blue, and green subpixel can display 1,024 shades, 
which creates over one Billion Colors! Now we’re talking.

40
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:45.800
How does this alleviate contrast bandwidth limitations? 
Imagine you have a dark scene with bright elements, such a river illuminated by moonlight. 

41
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:57.000
The TV will only accurately display shadow detail in the dark parts while washing out the bright parts, 
or only accurately displays the bright parts while muddying dark areas of the screen. 

42
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:03.800
With over one Billion Rich Colors, the content can have more detail in the bright areas 
AND the dark areas of the image. 

43
00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.000
Color banding is also alleviated with over one Billion Rich Colors.

44
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:19.600
The fact that conventional TVs can only display 256 shades of each subpixel causes problems when 
there are multiple shades of the same color that go from dark to light or vice versa. 

45
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:28.000
Imagine a sky with a hot air balloon. The sky isn’t all one uniform shade, and since 
conventional sets have a limited number of colors to choose from, 

46
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:33.000
the cutoff between shades is sharp, leaving the customer viewing obvious bands in-between. 

47
00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:42.400
With technologies to display over one Billion Rich Colors, the transition is smooth between shades and
exhibits a scene more like you’d see in real life. 

48
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:56.200
Let’s recap all of the amazing features that are realized with the IPS 4K Quantum Display.
Wider Viewing Angles that deliver more accurate color and contrast from virtually any seat in the house.

49
00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:03.300
Higher Peak Brightness and better black levels
for contrast levels that will help deliver the best picture quality possible

50
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Improved Black Levels and picture detail with Local Dimming,

51
00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:19.000
And... Technologies that display over one Billion Rich Colors that allow for lifelike, 
vivid images and virtually eliminate problems like contrast bandwidth issues and color banding.

52
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Higher-quality beans make better coffee, and a higher-quality TV panel makes a better TV. 
With LG’s IPS 4K Quantum Display, you will get a truly superior viewing experience.

53
00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:44.000
If this is the cake, just wait until we get to the icing: Super HDR with Dolby Vision<span style="font-size:15px"><sup>TM</sup></span> support.  
Find out in the next module how these features make an already great viewing experience even better!
